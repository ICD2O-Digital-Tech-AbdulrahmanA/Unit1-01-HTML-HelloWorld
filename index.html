    <p>My name is Abdul and I am a grade 10 student at Immaculata.</p>
    <h2>My Favourite Pastime:</h2>
      <p>My favourite pastime is playing Video Games. I find it a good way to keep my mind off of things that worry me, a way to escape the worries of reality.</p>
    <h2>My Least Favourite Subject</h2>
      <p>My least favourite subject is English. I dislike when I'm given boundaries when I'm writing, such as following an outline and using literary structure. When I don't have these limitations I am able to write more freely and a lot better.</p>
